## Key Features Implemented

### 1. PumpCharacteristic Class
- **Multiple curve types**: Polynomial, lookup table, linear
- **Flexible input formats**: Coefficients, data points, or pre-defined curves
- **Interpolation**: Automatic interpolation for table-based curves
- **Operating point calculation**: Find intersection with system resistance curves
- **Validation**: Input validation and bounds checking

### 2. Enhanced Network Flow Solver
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Optional pump characteristic**: New parameter `pump_characteristic` in solver
- **Automatic operating point finding**: Replaces simple pressure clipping
- **Fallback mechanism**: Uses legacy method if no pump characteristic provided
- **Enhanced solution info**: Additional pump-related output data

### 3. Utility Methods
- **System resistance estimation**: Calculate equivalent system resistance coefficient
- **Curve intersection**: Find pump curve and system curve intersection
- **Typical pump creation**: Factory methods for common pump types

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pump Curve Types Supported:

1. **Polynomial**: P = a₀ + a₁Q + a₂Q² + ...
2. **Table-based**: Linear interpolation between data points
3. **Linear**: P = a + bQ
4. **Typical centrifugal**: Quadratic curve with efficiency point

### Operating Point Algorithm:

1. Calculate system resistance from current flow and pressure drop
2. Use binary search to find intersection of pump curve and system curve
3. Update flow rate to operating point
4. Fallback to pressure-based reduction if intersection fails

### Integration with Existing Solver:

The pump characteristic logic is integrated into the existing iterative solver loop:

```python
# 4d) Pump characteristic evaluation (replaces simple clipping)
if pump_characteristic is not None:
    # Get available pressure from pump curve
    available_pressure = pump_characteristic.get_pressure(current_flow_rate)
    
    if available_pressure < required_p0:
        # Find operating point using curve intersection
        system_resistance = self._estimate_system_resistance(...)
        operating_flow, operating_pressure = pump_characteristic.find_operating_point(...)
        current_flow_rate = operating_flow
else:
    # Legacy simple pressure clipping
    if required_p0 > pump_max_pressure:
        current_flow_rate *= (pump_max_pressure / required_p0) * 0.9
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```python
# Create pump characteristic
pump = PumpCharacteristic.create_typical_centrifugal_pump(
    max_pressure=800000,  # 800 kPa
    max_flow=0.015       # 15 L/s
)

# Use with solver
flows, info = solver.solve_network_flow_with_pump_physics(
    network=network,
    pump_flow_rate=0.008,
    temperature=60.0,
    pump_characteristic=pump  # New parameter
)
```

### Manufacturer Data:
```python
# From performance data
flow_points = [0.0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.010]
pressure_points = [900000, 880000, 840000, 780000, 700000, 600000]

pump = PumpCharacteristic.create_from_manufacturer_data(
    flow_points=flow_points,
    pressure_points=pressure_points
)
```
