# DRY Refactoring: Unified Path-Finding Logic

## Summary

Successfully consolidated duplicate path-finding logic by eliminating code duplication between `network_utils.find_all_paths()` and `FlowNetwork.get_paths_to_outlets()`. Both functions previously implemented nearly identical depth-first search (DFS) algorithms.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `network_utils.find_all_paths()` (Primary Implementation)
- **File**: `lubrication_flow_package/utils/network_utils.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional `raise_on_no_paths` parameter (default: `True`)
  - Enhanced documentation to clarify this is the unified DFS implementation
  - Maintained backward compatibility for existing callers

### 2. Refactored `FlowNetwork.get_paths_to_outlets()` (Now Delegates)
- **File**: `lubrication_flow_package/network/flow_network.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed duplicate DFS implementation (25 lines of code eliminated)
  - Now delegates to `find_all_paths(self, raise_on_no_paths=False)`
  - Maintains exact same public interface and behavior
  - Uses local import to avoid circular dependencies

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused Import
- **File**: `lubrication_flow_package/solvers/network_flow_solver.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed unused import of `find_all_paths` from network_utils

## Benefits Achieved

1. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated ~25 lines of duplicate DFS code
2. **Single Source of Truth**: All path-finding logic now centralized in one function
3. **Maintainability**: Future improvements to path-finding algorithm only need to be made in one place
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work without changes
5. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Added optional error handling parameter for different use cases

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Both methods return identical results for the same network
- ✅ Error handling works correctly for edge cases (no inlet, no outlets, no paths)
- ✅ Existing demo functionality continues to work
- ✅ All import dependencies resolved correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Reduced Complexity**: Single DFS implementation instead of two
- **Better Documentation**: Clear indication of unified implementation
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Configurable behavior for different use cases
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused imports

## Files Modified

1. `lubrication_flow_package/utils/network_utils.py` - Enhanced unified function
2. `lubrication_flow_package/network/flow_network.py` - Refactored to delegate
3. `lubrication_flow_package/solvers/network_flow_solver.py` - Cleaned imports

## Migration Notes

No migration required - all existing code continues to work as before. The refactoring is completely transparent to existing users of the API.
